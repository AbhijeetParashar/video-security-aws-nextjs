## Overview

This demo project is built using Next.js to showcase different video streaming techniques for secure and efficient video delivery. It includes examples of using:

- **AWS S3 + CloudFront with Signed URLs**: Secure video delivery using AWS S3 for storage and CloudFront for content delivery with signed URLs.
- **MUX**: A video platform providing hosting, transcoding, and streaming services with analytics.
- **AWS S3 + CloudFront + MediaConvert**: A pipeline for video transcoding and delivery using AWS services.

## Techniques

### AWS S3 + CloudFront with Signed URLs

This technique uses AWS S3 to store video files and AWS CloudFront as the CDN to distribute content. Signed URLs are generated to restrict access to authorized users only, providing secure video delivery.

#### Features

- Secure video streaming with restricted access.
- Content delivery through AWS CloudFront.
- Serverless architecture.

### MUX

MUX provides a powerful video platform with capabilities like hosting, transcoding, and streaming. It also offers detailed video analytics and monitoring tools.

#### Features

- Easy integration with RESTful API.
- Automatic transcoding and adaptive bitrate streaming.
- Advanced video analytics.

### AWS S3 + CloudFront + MediaConvert

This approach utilizes AWS MediaConvert to transcode videos stored in S3. The transcoded videos are then delivered via AWS CloudFront, optimizing the delivery for different devices and network conditions.

#### Features

- High-quality video transcoding with AWS MediaConvert.
- Adaptive bitrate streaming for various devices.
- Secure content delivery with AWS CloudFront.
